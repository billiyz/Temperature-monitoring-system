# Temperature-monitoring-system
We did this project as a team for data science,machine learning,IOT,deep learning and artificial intelligence for enhancing the skills and big data handling.thanks to group members at https://github.com/DekutIOTDataScience/Temp-system we made it.
this system controls the temperature of a body,takes the data and strams the data live on M2X cloud,this prototype can be used for air conditioning and electronics peripheral cooling system,the data collected is used for training of the system using jupyter notebook having python,numpy,matplotlib,and other libraries.
